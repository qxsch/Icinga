# Config Diff

Generates a beautiful diff between different configurations:
 * understands the configuration & just prints real changes
 * parses Icinga Core 1 & Nagios configurations
 * writes configuration ERRORS / WARNINGS
 * can be exended with custom cfgProcessors (to normalize or ignore values/objects)
